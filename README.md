## ‚ú® Features

- **Dark & Light mode support**  
  Automatically adapts to the device‚Äôs current theme using React Navigation's built-in theming support.

- **Send local notifications (immediate or scheduled)**  
  Use the "Send" tab to send a local push notification instantly or with a custom delay in seconds. The form supports title, body, and selecting one of three types: Info, Error, or Warning.

- **Unread badge on Inbox tab + App Icon Badge (iOS only)**  
  The Inbox tab icon shows a badge with the unread count. The app icon badge is also updated (only supported on iOS).  
  ‚Üí [Notifee iOS badge support](https://notifee.app/react-native/docs/ios/badges)

- **Pre-commit checks via Husky**  
  Automatically runs unit tests and linting before every commit using a Husky pre-commit hook.

- **Notification history in the Inbox tab**  
  Notifications sent or received are listed chronologically in the Inbox tab.

- **Unread indicator on each notification**  
  Unread notifications show a small round dot. Tapping a notification navigates the user to a detail screen.

- **State management with Zustand**  
  All local state and data handling is powered by Zustand, including notification inbox, UI flags, and shared values.

- **Encapsulated notification logic with custom hook**  
  The Notifee integration (permissions, listeners, local pushes) is abstracted into a reusable hook.

- **Deep linking via notifications**  
  Pressing a notification (foreground or background) opens the app and navigates to the detail screen, marking the item as read.

- **Custom linting and Prettier configuration for VSCode**  
  The repository includes editor settings to ensure consistent formatting and linting in development.

- **Ephemeral in-memory data**  
  All data is stored in memory ‚Äî there‚Äôs no disk or session persistence.
